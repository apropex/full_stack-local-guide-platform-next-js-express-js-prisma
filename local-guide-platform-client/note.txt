A $1.5 million mansion ravaged by fire hits the market. Engineers call it a

total loss. But one couple sees something else potential. With no

experience, they gamble their life savings on a skeletal ruin. What followed was 18 months of pure

chaos, painful setbacks, costs that keep climbing, a late night police call, and

disasters that turned every victory into a costly battle. Amidst the wreckage

they find hidden gems, treasures they hope can fund the project. This is the

story of a home everyone said couldn't be saved. Can they prove them all wrong?

An explosion at a mansion leads to a massive fire. And as crews tell our Sharon Tenqua, the home is at total

loss. The ceiling is collapsed and half of the house nearly down to its foundation. Months of renovation work

now up in flames. There are portions we save, but between the water damage and the fire damage and smoke damage, it probably will be a

loss. A few days later, the burnedout mansion

hits Zillow for $1.5 million. Thousands of people show interest, but

only one buyer will walk away with it. Mike and Linda first saw the mansion on

the evening news. What they didn't expect was to find it for sale. It comes

with nearly 5 acres of land and a guest house that survived the fire untouched.

As the listing goes viral, urgency kicks in. They book a viewing and the first

flight to Nashville. The race to claim the mansion has begun.

When they arrive, the pictures haven't prepared them for what they're seeing. The place is wrecked, burned from top to

bottom, and every breath still tastes like smoke.

As soon as the visit starts, they are told another buyer is also flying in today to see the property. So they just

have a few hours to make one of the most expensive decisions of their lives.

They need to assess if the investment is worth it and most importantly if the

house can be recovered. Are they really about to spend

everything they have saved on this? Is it truly worth $1.5 million?

The decision is final. Mike and Linda commit. The mansion's fate now rests in their

hands. And they have no idea what challenges lie ahead.

From here, everything moves fast. They pack up, relocate to the guest house,

and immediately start searching for the right team to begin the full-scale restoration.

Built in 1997 in Nashville, it had recently undergone two years of renovations by the original owners. But

as the work neared completion, the entire house went up in flames.

It started right here in the former library. While painters were applying lacquer, a spark ignited chemical fumes.

The fire spread fast, first through the room, then through the entire house.

 One worker was injured, but thankfully

no lives were lost. The family arrived to find their dream

home burning. Years of work and a great deal of money were gone in hours.

So, the question is simple. Can this ruin become a home again?

Before any rebuilding can happen, a plan of attack is needed. Mike meets with his contractor, James,

and the small team responsible for turning this devastating accident into a home.

Among them is John, a jack of all trades handyman.

He worked with the previous family and knows every detail, every corner from

before the fire. Now he's back bringing his experience

and insight to help rebuild the house.

And he has a surprise for Mike.

That's a secret room. No. Up here through this closet, there's a secret bedroom that was used as a

nursery. What? Secret rooms? Really? Oh my word,

dude. This is cute. And that was all the way through.

The house is filled with wellpreserved gems that could be turned for profit.

a chandelier with over 100 crystal pieces, a Romanstyle waterfall bathtub,

and exclusive marble countertops, which John says are worth thousands.

If they can save and resell these pieces, it could help offset the huge rebuild costs.

After a week of walkthroughs, inspections, and careful planning, the first walls come down, exposing the full

extent of the damage hidden within.

Once the house is stripped to its foundations, engineers will decide whether the house can be saved or if

they'll be forced to tear it all down and start from nothing.

This decision could threaten their entire investment.



The $13,000 Roman bathtub is too valuable to leave exposed to the elements. It takes several crew members

to carefully maneuver the 900lb tub out of the house.

There's no second chance if it cracks. For now, it will be kept safe from the

ongoing demolition, but selling it could bring in thousands. Money that could go straight into the renovation.



Mike and Linda are new to big renovations. Driven by a clear vision of what the place could become, they are

committed to making it happen despite their limited experience.

Can a family with no renovation background turn this million-doll disaster into their forever home?

As demolition progresses, concerns about the structural integrity continue to grow.

The verdicts hit on whether the restoration is possible or not.

Three different engineers have told Mike the house is a total loss. Their advice,

tear it down and start over.

This is not going well for me right now. I'm wondering if I just spent a whole lot of money on a whole lot of nothing.

One last chance remains. Marshall. His call decides whether this house lives or

dies.

They descend into the basement looking for any signs of damage from the thousands of gallons of water used to

fight the fire. A compromised foundation would be a

fatal flaw. The structural engineer explains that

not all burned wood is lost. Some can be tested and saved.

The conclusion is in. Rebuilding is possible.

But good news fades fast. It's May and rain keeps pouring in Nashville, seeping

through the exposed roof. If the house doesn't dry out soon, the wood could suffer long-term damage, delaying the

entire rebuild and driving up costs. A specialized crew climbs onto the

precarious structure and starts the dangerous work of tearing it apart piece by piece.

The roof is beyond saving. It will need to be completely torn off and rebuilt from scratch.

With more rain forecast for tonight, Mike spends $500 on an improvised tarp

to cover the most vulnerable section of the open roof. It's a temporary fix, but

the best chance to keep the damage from getting worse.

They took some rain here overnight. It was a serious storm. Look at all that floor there.

Yeah.

The water has found its way in, but there's no stopping. Standing two floors above the ground, the crew tosses down

what's left of the roof. The demolition has to keep moving before the next rain hits.

To accelerate the build, the crew brings on a 10,000lb forklift. But the weight

is crushing the driveway, which until now was in perfect condition. A repair

like this is nowhere in the budget. Their only hope is to lay down wooden planks to distribute the load.



To begin framing the new roof, the team has to solve a complex problem. how to

lift hundreds of pounds of structural beams two stories high. It's a job for a

60,000 lb crane. But with the machine costing thousands per day, the budget

forces them to find another way.

 Their solution is a 27 ft homemade ladder pieced together from leftover

lumber. It won't just be for climbing. It will become their makeshift ramp to

haul the massive beams into position and rebuild the mansion's most devastated space, the library, where the fire

began. 

Work is moving fast, but not without consequences. The pavement cracked under

the weight of the forklift, turning a small problem into a costly one.

But headaches continue for Mike. My columns gone. I don't think we're

moving the columns. I don't think we're moving the columns. No, when I was talking to James yesterday,

we were going to keep them. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Take it out. Yeah. I don't think we're taking them

out. Mike has been clear from the start. Save

every single column. At $30,000 each, they are the most valuable relic of the

old mansion. The cost-saving plan to keep the

original columns is out the window. And now he has to find a solution for a very

expensive mistake.

While problems pop up on the ground, the pace of construction on top of the house is incredible. After the tarps failed,

and with the constant threat of more rain, getting a permanent roof is priority number one.

Mike just spent $33,000 in lumber to get it framed.

 The mansion's original blueprints were lost in the fire, but with decades of

experience behind them, the crew created a brand new set of plans from scratch to

guide the rebuild.

Constructors have been working non-stop, and for the first time, the mansion is no longer a ruin, but a fully enclosed

structure, finally sealed off from the relentless Nashville rain. It marks one

of the project's biggest milestones since construction began 3 months ago.

Just as they're ready to move forward inside, an inspector shows up unannounced.

I just got a marking asset there. He has in front of him. Just sign off. Ain't nothing in the computer.

We have it. We have it on the computer. Stacy sent it in. I just looked at it.

Yeah, Mark said it's on his desk. He just has signed off on. He knows what we're doing. I thought Mark did it with that.

It's so I promise. Okay. It's just funny. I won't give you

a hard time. You know that. I ain't worried about hard time. Okay, thank you.

The permits are all in place. The crew is clear to continue without delay.

These iron railings originally cost around $90,000. They were handcrafted and today their

value would easily top six figures.

Mike's new modern vision for the house leans more minimalist and Scandinavian inspired.

Ornate curved railings no longer fit the aesthetic. While they won't be used in the renovation, they definitely won't go

to waste. He knows exactly what they're worth, and he's determined to save every

piece. 

A major problem looms outside. Replacing the original columns would cost a fortune. So they come up with a clever

cost-saving solution. Framing massive square pillars around the surviving round ones. The originals will be hidden

but fully preserved inside.

The oversized pillars overwhelm the roof line, throwing off the home's visual balance. To fix it, dormers are added.

With the exterior taking shape, attention turns to one of the home's most defining elements, the windows. The

original design featured dozens of curved openings, but from the very beginning, Mike and Linda have been set

on replacing them with large rectangular ones. Their goal is to flood every room

with natural light and create a seamless connection to the 5 acre property

beyond. In some areas, that vision means tearing

down brick walls to expand window openings from 3 to 4 and re-engineering

parts of the structure to accommodate the new design.

What's going on there guys? How you doing? How are we doing? Good, man. I'm Ben with Bella.

A visitor arrives. This is Ben from Pella Windows. He saw the project online and has come

to make a pitch in person, hoping to secure the massive contract for this build. So, this is two rooms to demo

right here. You should have seen it before. The next day, Mike and Linda are at the showroom to finalize the details.

After seeing the quality, they make a call. They're going with Pella, but it's

a monumental commitment, a sixf figureure deal. The single biggest expense of the

project so far and one of the biggest checks Mike's ever written.

Before the order can be placed comes the most nerve-wracking part, the measurements.

Every single window will be custommade. There are no second chances. If a measurement is off by even an inch, a

$10,000 window becomes worthless. Double and triple checks are made by Mike's

team, the framers, and the supplier with a final review before placing the order.

With a six-f figureure window bill on the way, the family gets to work turning the mansion's salvaged items into cash.

 The fireplace mantle sells. 

The refrigerator is gone. But the biggest potential prize is the

$13,000 Roman tub. They scrub it clean and list it on eBay. The hope is that it

will attract a buyer with deep pockets. Because in a renovation this size, every

single dollar counts. With the house sealed by the waterproof

membrane, the final step begins. This is the part that looks simple but requires

years of expertise. Laying the shingles.

This phase of the job is all about managing danger. The crew is working on a steep two-story

roof with a long drop to the ground below.



 The result, a flawless finish that finally makes the house whole again.

The old subfloor, damaged by months of water and smoke, has to come up. This

strips the house down to its bare joists one last time, preparing it for the true

rebuild to begin.

The final frontier of demolition is the basement. Out of this space, they plan

to build something incredible. A state-of-the-art movie theater, a custom wine celler, a fully equipped gym, and a

new office for money. And then a huge break. The custom

windows expected to take up to 12 weeks have arrived in just three.

James, the contractor, can't believe it. This is when Mike gave him the news yesterday.

About 3 weeks ago, we paid for our windows that originally we were worried we're going to take 12 to 18 weeks, but

they said it would take about 6 weeks. In actual fact, they are ready. Except I haven't told James yet. So, I'm about to

break the good news to him. And I don't know if it's going to be good news or not because he may have a heart attack realizing we've got to now install these

windows and we might not be ready for them. So I guess we're going to find out in just a few minutes.

My man Ben from Pella calls. Uhoh. The windows are here. No. Straight up. It's like when do you want

them? Dude, I just got goosebumps. Uh, so it's only been 3 weeks. Ben, you said six.

Crack. I'm going to use Well, I just texted him and I was like, Ben, just trying to get an update. you know, do you think we're going to be

good for like, you know, early June? And he literally calls me. He's like, "Mike, the windows are in. Like, when do you

want them?" Said, "Well, not sure we can take him today, but I'll talk to James tomorrow."

That's huge. Oh my god. Like super pumped. That's I know. Miracle for custom windows. Miracle.

Never happens. Right. Ever. It's a rare piece of good news that puts

the project months ahead of schedule. Now comes the hard part. Some of these

custom panes weigh nearly 300 lb. It's a six-f figureure order and there's no

insurance for a dropped window.

Every measurement and cut made weeks ago comes down to this one moment. Will all windows fit?

The wait pays off. Each window fits exactly as planned. Relief washes over

Mike and James. The second floor windows raise the

stakes even higher. How do you lift a 300lb pane of glass two stories up with

no crane? Their plan is pure brute force and a ladder. A risky approach that

could easily lead to disaster.

One slip and a $10,000 window shatters into a million pieces. The pressure on

the crew is immense. It's nothing.

It's

 for days. They work meticulously lifting

and setting each custom frame into place. The installation is a masterclass in

precision and teamwork. And as each window slides into place, the vision

becomes a reality. In Mike's vision to blur the line

between the house and the surrounding 5 acres, one feature stands out as the crown jewel, a massive 16 ft sliding

door. It's one of the largest, most complex, and most expensive components in the

entire Pella order.

With its new walls of glass in place, the mansion's transformed character now stands clear. But this victory

immediately creates an unforeseen problem. The very windows designed to bring the

outside in have also left the family completely exposed to the outside world.

Privacy has suddenly become priority number one. To solve it, a line of 50 fast growing

trees is planted.

Mike takes on the tree clearing himself despite having zero experience with heavy machinery. Now, the biggest threat

to the property's fence is the man behind the controls.

 It's another mistake that drives the budget up.

 Before closing the walls, spray foam insulation is applied to seal every

crack and gap. This creates a strong thermal barrier that cuts heating and

cooling costs and adds soundproofing.

The science is impressive. Two liquid compounds are mixed in the nozzle, creating an instant chemical reaction.

What starts as a liquid spray hits the wall and immediately expands up to 100 times its original volume.

 This not only creates a perfect airtight seal, but it also adds structural

strength to the walls themselves. A welcome bonus in a house that's been rebuilt from the ground up.

Outside, the workers are locked in an inchbyin battle. Each brick must be

removed without disturbing the surrounding wall so new ones can be poured into place.

With the brick work repaired, the columns come next. Now standing as the home's structural

anchors, they need protection, too.

With a history of fire behind it, the mansion demands an electrical system built to the highest standard. But just

as the work is done, a frightening event shakes the job site that night.

So last night, we got home late about , , and there's a car parked out front facing my driveway, and he puts

his hazard lights on. So, we park up and then these guys decide they're going to turn around real slow and drive off. So,

it seemed as though they were looking at the house. We went in the house and we're pretty sure we heard some sounds or something upstairs. Someone talking.

So, the siren you can hear is police on the way.

The police search the property but find nothing. No intruders, nothing stolen.

It's a false alarm.

Remember that lull that tore up the pavement? That was a warning shot.

Now, an even bigger concern is rolling in. A 60,000lb monster is on its way. A

crane set to lift another 40,000 lb of wall material.

It's the only way to keep the project on track. But placing 100,000 lb on a

cracked driveway risks collapsing it entirely.

As if things weren't tense enough, a $500 pile of gravel, unordered and

unwanted, gets dumped right in the middle of the driveway. A bizarre mistake at the worst possible time.

It's a roadblock. Now the heavy truck has no choice but to drive over the

fragile limestone pavers. The driveway is already at its limit and Mike is

furious. It's not often I get frustrated by things like really ticked off, but this ticks me off. It's bad enough that

they delivered it. The fact that we don't even order it is a whole different thing. Now he's riding on my limestone.

You know, people make mistakes and I'm the one that pays for it. Like what's the deal?

With outside delays piling up, the pressure is on to make up for lost time inside.

In a brilliant piece of job site engineering, the team builds a temporary bridge over the gaping hole for the main

staircase, creating a few feet of extra corridor space to work faster, safer,

and more efficiently. 

After months of looking at exposed studs and raw insulation, the crew begins the monumental task of hanging drywall. They

must maneuver thousands of square feet of heavy, unwieldy board through a maze

of framing and up two stories.

It's a change that happens with breathtaking speed. With every sheet that goes up, the raw

construction site disappears and the clean, smooth lines of a finished room

begin to emerge.

While the final vision is overwhelmingly modern and linear, soft curved arches

are intentionally preserved in the hallways. A subtle, graceful break from the hard angles designed to add visual

interest and flow to the massive space. 

The replacement of the staircase is a masterpiece of minimalist design. straight and powerful. It will feature

solid white oak on its treads, handrails, and posts.

The second floor hallway is designed to be narrower, giving it a gallery-like feel that guides you through the home's

rooms. Seeing these walls is a massive victory.

They've survived demolition, battled the Nashville rain, and navigated costly mistakes from the driveway to the

columns. From selling the salvaged gems, they've managed to claw back around $10,000.

A small but hard-one victory against a budget that is constantly under pressure.

 The brutal structural phase of the build

is over. The house is now a pristine white canvas. And now the art of

finishing it begins. Every decision from here on out is about color, texture, and

personality. And the first stroke of the brush will be the tile.

It's not just a small job for a few bathrooms. Tylers will be working all over the mansion. in the laundry room,

the custom wine celler, and the gym. Laying down thousands of square feet of

expensive imported stone, it's the first layer of luxury to be

applied to the home's interior with a budget that will quickly climb close to six figures.

In the bathrooms, distinct personalities shine through. One features sparkling Italian marble.

Another is a dramatic matte black space wrapped floor to ceiling in honed black marble.

Both bathrooms feature heated floors, a hidden touch of comfort that keeps them

warm and inviting. 

The centerpiece of it all is the master bathroom. The choice, huge slabs with a

subtle igloo look. At over $100 per tile, the material alone for this one

room costs $20,000. It's a massive investment to make what Mike calls the best room in the house.

With the tiling setting a luxurious foundation, the trim phase begins. It's

the clearest proof of the project's core principle, choosing quality over convenience, even when it comes at a

higher price. The closet areas in the master bedroom

and kids rooms are built out all the way to the ceiling to maximize space.

The new straight staircase is a statement piece. the selected material,

solid white oak. It's on the treads, the handrails, and the posts, tying the

entire minimalist design together with its clean, natural warmth.

To break up the vertical lines of the railings and landings, Mike introduces a custommade slat wall.

 The slats are staggered with precise

2-in gaps, creating a semi-transparent wall that provides separation and

privacy while still allowing natural light to pour through.

This final artistic touch elevates the interior from a simple structure to a

piece of custom architecture.

The first pieces of furniture arrive. They are chosen to reflect the design's clean, modern spirit.

Among them are the floating vanities that bring a sense of lightness and elegance to the bathrooms.

outside. The house is about to receive a full exterior treatment that will bring the entire structure together under one

consistent finish.

A clean coat of white will cover both the original walls and the new additions, visually blending them into a

single cohesive structure.

The goal is a unified modern appearance that eliminates the contrast between old

and new construction.

It's the final step that covers the last scars of the fire, allowing the house to

leave its tragic past behind and stand as a single new creation.

What started as a few low spots caused by a heavy forklift quickly spiraled.

The weight of cranes and delivery trucks created a web of stress fractures, turning a small problem into an

unsalvageable mess.

100,000 lb rolled over the fractured pavement. That's the weight of a

commercial airliner. It was the single heaviest load the driveway had to endure

and the point of no return. Guided by his philosophy to do it right,

Mike surrenders. The entire driveway is to be torn out and replaced.

It's a massive unbudgeted hiccup born from a few initial cracks. $100,000 just

in concrete. The driveway has been Mike's biggest headache. But the problems don't stop

there. An old worn pa gravel section sits beside the new stones, turning the

mansion's entire entrance into a visual mess. The materials differ in color and thickness, creating a mismatched look.

The only option is to redo the salvaged paving, too, adding a costly setback with every new square foot.

The new driveway marks the finish line. After more than 500 days of demolition,

surprises, and non-stop construction, the renovation is finally complete.

Just 18 months ago, this was a shell ravaged by fire. Three expert engineers

declared it a total loss and advised them to tear it down. And at every turn

the house seemed determined to prove them right.

But now standing in the finished home filled with light custom design and

carefully chosen furniture, it's clear they didn't just prove the experts

wrong. They exceeded every expectation.

This renovation challenged them with relentless rain that flooded the exposed structure. It revealed a fire ravaged

frame on the verge of collapse. It pushed their budget to the limit with constant surprises and soaring material

costs. From the ashes of that devastation, a

family with no renovation experience, but armed with a clear vision and a trusted team, didn't just rebuild a

house. They created a home.

It was a journey that tested their patience, their finances, and their resolve at every turn. And now it stands

as proof that sometimes the impossible is just waiting for someone brave enough to try.

[Applause] 

You can have all your spices and things so they just kind of work, all that kind of fun stuff. The pull outs. I mean,

little drawer microwave. Love that it's built in. Love that it's out the way. I don't have to just got to push to open,

push to close,

no extensions, no expansions. Just a nice solid oak table and chairs

again. Thank you, Restoration Hardware. 

We wanted the views. We wanted the light. It looks windy out there. 


This is my little uh fruits and vegetables kind kind of thing. So, we did the grills, keep the air flow in

them. I can see what's in them.

Funky little uh wash basin so we could take advantage of the space nicely. And

we got the fourc car garage. Did the full view glass door so we can get lots of natural light in here. Hexagons on

the ceiling. Went with the black vibes so it looks really good at nighttime when it's dark out there. Did the quiet

motion openers there up on the side?
